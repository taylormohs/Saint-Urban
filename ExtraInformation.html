            <h4>Call Outs & Terminology</h4>
            <h4 id="h4-description">3-part callouts help maximize efficiency - What are you doing - How many hands do you have - What needs to be done</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><button class="title">Heard - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">The most used term in the restaurant. It communicates not only that you have physically heard a teammate's callout, but that you are owning the task. You should only say heard if you are able to complete the task and should also specify what task you are responding to (i.e. "Heard Greet on 51").</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Working a First - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This communicates to the team that you have greeted a table and you are ringing in/making their beverages. Please verbalize which table you're working a first round for.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">We Need a Greet On - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This communicates that a greet is needed on a specific table. The only time you would not stop to get a greet in the dining room is if you are already on a first round or your hands are fully of dirty dishes (in which case you should still pause at the table to let them know someone will be right with them).</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Look Left - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This means we need drink runners at the service well. Usually the expo of bartenders will call this, but if you are walking out with full hands and see drinks that need to be run, please take a step back and call down the line for them.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">Drop & Go / What Do You Need - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">For efficiency, there should only ever be one person in dish at a time. If you come in and someone else is there, tell them to "Drop & Go" which literally means to set down their plates and leave dish. They should then respond with "What Do You Need?" This is your chance to pass off a task to them while you are taking care of both your dishes.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Hand Up - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Anytime an expeditor needs a manager (re-cooks, dragging food, high time tickets, etc.), they will raise their hand. This should alert not only the manager but the entire FOH staff that a manager is needed at expo and it then becomes everyone's job to find the manager and alert them that there's a "hand up" in expo.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Turn & Pull - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">After dropping items in the dish pit, please look for and grab any clean glassware, china or silverware that needs to be polished or brought to the line or bar.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Hands - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">The following are used to let the expo and other servers know how many free hands you have to carry plates, glassware, etc.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full Hands</strong> means you have nothing else to carry to the floor and can take the maximum 3 plate carry or any other tast a teammate may need</li>
                    <li><strong>Two Plate</strong> means you are taking one thing out already (i.e. app plates, a refill jug, etc.) but can carry two plates from the window</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy / One Hand</strong> means you are taking a few things out to the floor already but can carry one plate or perhaps a beverage or refill jug for someone</li>
                </ul></div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">Working a Guest Request - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">A guest request is something the guest needs to continue enjoying their meal (i.e. a fork, ketchup, butter, etc.) and should be brought back to the guest immediately. While it is a top priority, you can still take an easy/one hand out.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">Walking (Water, Tea, Diet, etc.) - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This notifies the team that you are walking a refill jar out to the dining room and allows them to alert you if any of their tables need that same refill. Even if no one call back that they need it, you should still be circulating through the dining room and looking for opportunities to empty the jar before coming back.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">We Need Bus / Wipe & Reset Hands On - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This notifies the team which tables need to be bussed and/or have been bussed and need to be wiped and reset.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">We Need Manicure Hands On - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">We manicure (or pre-bus) our tables down to the wood. This means that only one primary beverage glass should be left on the table for each guest when they get up to leave. This call means there are empty plates, glasses, or trash on the table that needs to be removed.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">Seating / Front Door Hands - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This means that there are either guests at the front door who need to be greeted (perhaps it's at a time when only one greeter is on and they are on the phone or seating another party) or we have several parties up front and need help seating.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Corner In / Out - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">To prevent collisions, you should always say corner when coming in and out of the kitchen (or any corner in the restaurant with a blind spot).</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Coming Down - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This should be used when you are literally walking down the expo line. It lets the expeditor know you are available. It should always be followed with another call (i.e. "Coming Down, Full Hands").</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">5 & Go - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This is a call used mid-shift to let everyone know they need to take a moment during their circulating to polish or roll 5 plates/silverware and then keep going. This ensures we never run out of silverware or clean plates in expo or on the floor.</div></li><br>
            </ul>

              <h4>Service Priorities</h4>
              <h4 id="h4-description">Service style is to always be - Accommodating . Professional . Proactive . Hospitable . Silent . Confident . Consistent</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><button class="title">Guest Request - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This is something the guest needs to to continue enjoying their meal and should be out to them in 90 seconds or less.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title left">Greet / First Round Drinks - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Greets should happen in 90 seconds or less and first round drinks should be delivered in 3 minutes or less. While you can consolidate this step, don't do anything that may cause you to get caught up at a table (i.e. another greet, taking an order, etc).</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title left">Food Running (Hot Food Hot / Cold Food Cold) - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">These should also be prioritized in that order; hot food should always be run before cold food.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title left">Drink Running (Look Left) - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">You should be checking the service well every time you leave expo and taking out whatever you can.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title">Guest Payment - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">When a guest has put down a cc or cash, they are usually ready to leave. This means we need to get their payment processed and changed returned as quickly as possible. This step can be consolidated with many others; anyone walking by with a handheld should stop to run payments for tables.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title">Drink Refills - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This can always be consolidated with other steps. If you have a free hand, you should be walking a refill jug through the dining room.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title left">Manicuring / Bussing Tables - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">And not just your own! Again, any time you are circulating through the dining room (unless you are working a guest request), you have time to manicure or bus a table.</div></li><br>
                <p><strong>There are many more things to add to the list (i.e. marking, wine service, order taking, etc.) but everyone should be aware of all the above priorities and where they sit in relation to each other.</strong></p><br>
            </ul>
              </div>

            <h4>Service Steps</h4>
            <h4 id="h4-description">Service style is to always be - Accommodating . Professional . Proactive . Hospitable . Silent . Confident . Consistent</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><button class="title">Greet & Stage the Table - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Table should be greeted within 90 seconds. While introducing yourself and offering a beverage, stage the table by moving condiments away from the center to make room for appetizers, extra plates and dessert. Any featured cocktails should be described to the table at this time.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">First Round - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">The first round (including bar beverages) should be on the table within 3 minutes.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Feature - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">You should feature the table while delivering the first-round beverages. Give all the features for the day/night at once, including dessert.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Take Appetizer Order - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Ask for an appetizer order before leaving the table after featuring.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">Place Side Plates on Table - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">If they order an appetizer, plates should be stacked at the edge of the table <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately</span> after ringing the order in.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Take Entree Order - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">If the guests are ready (or decline an appetizer), this should happen right after featuring as well. If not, it should be done before the appetizer is delivered.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Quality Check / Remark - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">2 bites / 2 minutes after appetizers hit the table. Re-mark any silverware a guest is using so they have fresh silverware for their next course.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Manicure - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">All appetizer plates and used silverware should be manicured off the table before entrees arrive.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Quality Check - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">2 bites / 2 minutes after entrees hit the table.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Manicure - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Manicuring should be done periodically throughout the meal while trying to bus down to the wood, leaving only one beverage glass per person by the end of the meal.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Offer Dessert / Coffee - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This should happen when the last entree plate is cleared off the table. When asking if they'd like coffee, we do not ask decaf or regular but do ask if they'd like cream.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title">Mark - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">If the table orders dessert, mark them with the proper utensil (ice cream = spoon; everything else = fork). Only one utensil per guest should be brought for desserts. Utensils (like app plates) should be marked <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately</span> after ringing the dessert order in. If the guest orders coffee and dessert, please place the dessert on hold until after the coffee has been delivered.</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">Quality Check / Drop Check - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Dropping the check should occur when you quality check the dessert. If the table does not order dessert, it should happen immediately after they decline dessert & coffee (within 2 minutes).</div></li><br>
              <li><button class="title left">Run Payments / Say Goodbye - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Running payments should happen as closely to when they place payment in the boat as possible (within 2 minutes). Make sure to say goodbye and thank you before they leave! Table should be bussed, wiped and re-set in 90 seconds.</div></li><br>
            </ul>

            <div class="columns">
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <h4 id="h4-description" class="left-column" style="text-decoration: underline;">Homebase Server's Responsibilities</h4>
            
                <li><button class="title left-column">Guest Requests - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">A guest request is classified as something a guest needs to begin or continue enjoying their meal (condiments, silverware, etc.). Guest requests are our highest priority responsibility and must be performed within 90 seconds. Please do not pass off guest requests, even if it's for another server's table.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title left-column">Greets & First Round Drinks - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">Greet each table within 90 seconds of arrival. As you circulate through the restaurant, greet any newly sat table as if it were your own. If you are getting a guest request, a first round or have dirty dishes in your hand, acknowledge the table and let them know you or someone will be with them shortly. Treat our guests as if they have been to our restaurant before. Welcome them back as if they were old friends; there is no need for formality. Begin with a warm smile and a sincere welcome. Offer to bring a beverage, perhaps something from the bar; offer to make a wine suggestion. Inject your personality when interacting with our guests while maintaining your professionalism. The server who took the order should also be the one to deliver the first-round drinks within 3 minutes.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title left-column">Running Food & Drinks - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">With our teamwork system, every server is responsible for running food and bar drinks to any table in the restaurant. The goal is to keep hot food hot and cold food cold. Speed and awareness are crucial. You are the last check on food quality before it reaches the guest. If something does not look correct, ask the expeditor. Be aware of what you are running, how it is cooked, the proper pivot points and accompanying side items. Read the ticket carefully (especially with modifications) before you leave the kitchen or service well. Place food and beverages quietly on the table, directly in front of the guest with the protein facing the guest and the beverages at the top right of their place setting. Be aware if guests need to be remarked with fresh silverware. The last server to drop food should visually scan the table and verbally check if the guests need anything else to enjoy their meal.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title left-column">Refills - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">It is everyone's job to call for, walk and run refills to tables in the restaurant. We never want a guest sitting with an empty glass in front of them.</div></li><br>
            </ul>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <h4 id="h4-description" class="right-column" style="text-decoration: underline;">Everyone's Responsibilities</h4>
                <li><button class="title right-column">Taking Guests' Orders - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">By taking their own guests' orders the home base server is aware of all, if any, of the guests' requests and needs. This also allows the server to guide the guest and know exactly where and when the guest may need something.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title right-column">Perform a Quality Check - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">ONLY the home base server should inquire how a guests' appetizer, salad and/or entree taste. More than one server doing so unnecessarily interrupts the guest and makes our system look amateurish and unsophisticated.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title right-column">Offer Dessert & Coffee - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">This should be done after all the entree plates are cleared. This ensures more than one person isn't offering and the home base server already knows the guests' preferences, allergies, etc.</div></li><br>
                <li><button class="title right-column">Drop the Check & Say Goodbye - </button><br><br><div style="display: none" class="description">The guest must be thanked with warmth and sincerity. It is the home base server's obligation to tell the guests what a pleasure it was to wait on them. While dropping the check is the home base server's responsibility, everyone can (and should) run payments for any table.</div></li><br>
