                <li><strong>Owner- </strong>Christopher Collins</li><br>
                <li><strong>Director of Operations / Culinary- </strong>Richard Provencal</li><br>
                <li><strong>Service & Hospitality / HR- </strong>Shea Provencal</li><br>
                <li><strong>FOH Operations- </strong>Brittany Marycz</li><br>

                <li><strong>BOH Operations- </strong>Garret Verhage</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h5 id="about-section">About the Owner</h5>
                <p id="about-paragraph">Chris's hospitality career started when he was five years old, carrying out pies at Wally's Marie Callender's. From that point he knew he always wanted to follow his father's footsteps. A fourth-generation restaurateur, he started cooking in the kitchen at Wally's American Pub, learning what his father calls "an eye for business." He attended hospitality school at Boston University on a full athletic swimming scholarship and rotated internships in Boston, San Diego and Phoenix after. He staged with local chefs Beau McMillan and Lee Hilson. Recruited by Houston's, Chris began his professional career with one of the most prestigious restaurant companies in the US. With Houston's he traveled to LA, Houston, Orange County, DC and New Orleans, where he discovered his love for NOLA and had the idea for his first restaurant- Grassroots Kitchen & Tap. We now operate 6 concepts in Scottsdale and Phoenix- each tailored to the neighborhood they are in.</p>
                <h5 id="about-section">The Wally's Connection</h5>
                <p id="about-paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 4em;">Wally, Chris's father, himself continued the path of his grandfather, following his life's great passion, when he went from pilot to working under the wings of the late restaurant great Don Callender. Wally joined the opening crew that debuted 10 Marie Callender's retaurants in just two years and went on to own three Marie Callender's in Reno. However, Wally's own ideas were calling in which he answered by starting a catering and consulting business as well as innovating his own successful concepts. Notably, Wally worked with the famous "shock rock" legend to create Alice Cooperstown, a one-of-a-kind sports bar in Phoenix. Wally's most recent creation is his self-named gastropub, Wally's American Pub and Grill, which he started in Arcadia over 13 years ago. Wally and Matt Collins continue to keep the family tradition alive at the Arcadia location.</p>
